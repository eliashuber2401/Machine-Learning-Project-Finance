# Machine-Learning-Project-Finance
This Repository contains the Project "Predicting Market Direction from Technical Indicators" for the Course Applied Machine Learning in Python.

## Description
The Project focused on using machine learning algorithms to use several technical indicators to predict the future movement of financial assets. We will use various technical indicators to predict the trend of financial assets of tomorrow and up coming days to see if those technical indicators could predict the market directions. Then we will use the trained model to backtest on financial assets to see their performance.

## Getting Started


### Technical Indicators
For this Project we will be looking at the following Technical Indicators:
* Simple Moving Average (SME), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Band, Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), Lagged Returns and Rolling volatility (standard_deviation)
